# Driving License Generator

This project is used to generate driver's license images randomly, and all text content is fictional.  The output folder already contains images generated with ten different example backgrounds, with a hundred images for each variation.



The purpose of this project is to create a training dataset for the PPocr project. In order to facilitate collaboration within the company and avoid misunderstandings, the comments are written in Chinese. 



When generating a new training dataset, it is necessary to clear the DL_output folder.



If used solely for image generation, you can disregard Label.txt, fileState.txt, and cash.cash.
